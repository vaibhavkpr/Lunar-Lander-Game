The Space Probe Landing Simulator Game \\t\\t\\t\\t-Vaibhav Kapoor

With limited fuel on board, you will oversee the landing Nasa&#39;s Lunar Probe on the surface of the Moon. Using your exceptional piloting skills guide the probe out of the space station base orbiting the moon and while avoiding floating debris and asteroids, drift the probe down towards the surface for a soft landing without damaging the space exploration instruments on board.

The current version of the simulator features one level with a startup screen and the moon level. With future updates, additional environments and obstacles will be added for the player to navigate through. The game was prototyped in Processing for proof on concept and is now being fully converted to Java.
